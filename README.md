# Web map - Bikeability and Level of Traffic Stress in Denmark

This repository contains the code and vector tiles for a [web map](https://anerv.github.io/bikeability_webmap/) with selected results from an analysis of Level of Traffic Stress (LTS) and bikeability across Denmark.

See [dk_bicycle_network](https://github.com/anerv/dk_bicycle_network) and [dk_network_analysis](https://github.com/anerv/dk_network_analysis) for the data processing and analysis behind the map.

Based on data from OpenStreetMap, GeoDanmark, Statistics Denmark, and the GHSL.

The map has been developed based on this [guide](https://martinfleischmann.net/how-to-create-a-vector-based-web-map-hosted-on-github/).
